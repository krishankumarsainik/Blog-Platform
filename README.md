# Simple Blog Platform

## Project Overview

This project is a simple blog platform where the company can publish articles related to technology, industry trends, and company updates. The application is built using React and a CSS framework like Tailwind. It features a home page to display recent blog posts, a post detail page, and an admin page where authenticated users can create, edit, and delete blog posts.

## Features

1. **User Interface**

   - Modern, user-friendly interface using React and Tailwind CSS.
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.

2. **Pages**
   - **Home Page:** Displays a list of recent blog posts with titles, snippets, and publication dates.
   - **Post Detail Page:** Shows the full content of a selected blog post.
   - **Admin Page:** Allows authenticated users to create, edit, and delete blog posts.
3. **State Management**

   - Uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state within the application.

4. **Routing**

   - Implements client-side routing using `react-router-dom` to navigate between different pages (Home, Post Detail, Admin).

5. **Authentication**

   - Basic authentication for the admin page to restrict access to authorized users.

6. **Data Handling**
   - Uses local storage to store and retrieve blog post data.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
